    "Smoothing signals using a moving average\n",
    "========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "The moving average is an excellent filter to remove noise that is related to a specific time pattern. The classic example is the day-to-day evaluation of a process that is sensible to week-ends (for example, the number of workers who enter a building). A moving average with a window length of 7 days is ideal to evaluate the generic trend of this signal without considering intra-week fluctuations. Although its use in biomechanics is less obvious, this filter may be useful in some situation. This tutorial will show how to use the [ktk.filters.smooth()](../api/kineticstoolkit.filters.rst#kineticstoolkit.filters.smooth) function on TimeSeries data."
