    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction or reminder of the basic elements of rigid body geometry. It covers the definitions of bodies, coordinate systems, coordinates (such as points, vectors and frames), and homogeneous transforms. It follows the nomenclature conventions of Craig, J., 1987. Introduction to robotics: Mechanics and control, in the context of rigid body biomechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these notions largely come from the robotics field, they will be approached in the scope of rigid body biomechanics. As such, we will use the posture in Figure 1 all through the tutorial as an example for every introduced notion. To facilitate the comprehension, this is a bidimensional example; however, we will treat it as conventional 3D problem, with all z coordinates being set to zero."
