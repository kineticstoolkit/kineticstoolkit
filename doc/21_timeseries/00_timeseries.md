# TimeSeries

The [TimeSeries](../api/kineticstoolkit.TimeSeries.rst) class is used in most Kinetic Toolkit's modules and is the only class that users have to learn after python standard types and numpy arrays.

The three roles of the TimeSeries class are to:

1. organize multidimensional data in time;
2. manage events;
3. associate metadata to data.
